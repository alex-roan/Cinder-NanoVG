# Cinder-NanoVG

This is a C++11 wrapper for Mikko Mononen’s awesome GL-backed vector graphics renderer **NanoVG**. Additionally, it provides overloads for some of Cinder’s datatypes.

This project is not complete by any means. Features are being added as they are needed. Contributions are definitely welcome!
